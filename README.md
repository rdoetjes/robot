# Basic Collision Avoidance Robot for Raspberry Pi

This is the software to control a Raspberry Pi robot.
It's a vehicle driven by two motors (in my case a tank track). The motors are controlled by an H bridge.
The low-level classes Motor and RangeSensor are easily reusable for your own projects.
This code relies on WiringPi library
